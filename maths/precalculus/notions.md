##  Sets of Real Numbers and the Cartesian Coordinate Plane

A set is a well-defined collection of objects which are called the ‘elements’ 
of the set. ‘Well-defined’ means that it is possible to determine if something 
belongs to the collection or not, without prejudice.

Ways to describe

1. The Verbal Method: Use a sentence to define a set.
2. The Roster Method: Begin with a left brace ‘{’, list each element of the set
only once and then end with a right brace ‘}’.
3. The Set-Builder Method: A combination of the verbal and roster methods using
a “dummy variable” such as x

Combinations

* The intersection of A and B: A /U B = { x | x E A and x E B}
* The union of A and B: A U B = { x | x E A or x E B (or both) }
