##  Sets of Real Numbers and the Cartesian Coordinate Plane


A set is a well-defined collection of objects which are called the ‘elements’
of the set. ‘Well-defined’ means that it is possible to determine if something
belongs to the collection or not, without prejudice.

Ways to describe

1. The Verbal Method: Use a sentence to define a set.
2. The Roster Method: Begin with a left brace ‘{’, list each element of the set
only once and then end with a right brace ‘}’.
3. The Set-Builder Method: A combination of the verbal and roster methods using
a “dummy variable” such as x

Combinations

* The intersection of A and B: A /U B = { x | x E A and x E B}
* The union of A and B: A U B = { x | x E A or x E B (or both) }

## Symmetry

For Cartesian Coordinates:

1. about the x-axis: if a = c and b = -d
2. about the y-axis: if a = -c and b = d
3. about the origin: if a = -c and b = -d

## Reflection

point(x, y)

1. to x-axis: replace y with -y
2. to y-axis: replace x with -x
3. origin: replace x with -x and y with -y

## Distance between points
By the distance d between P and Q, we mean the length of the line segment
joining P with Q.

The Distance Formula: The distance d between the points P (x_0, y_0) and
Q(x_1, y_1) is:
d = sqrt((x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y1 - y0)^2

Related to finding the distance between two points is the problem of finding
the midpoint of the line segment connecting two points. Given two points,
P (x0, y0) and Q(x1, y1), the midpoint M of P and Q is dened to be the point
on the line segment connecting P and Q whose distance from P is equal to its
distance from Q.
