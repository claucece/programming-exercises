# Introduction

Data processed by computer:
1. Simple: one value in memory: int, real, char, bool, enum, subrange
2. Structured: : with a name they refer to various values in memory.

## Arrays

A finite, homogenous and ordered colection of elements.

* Finite: has a limit (maximal number)
* Homogeneous: all of its elements are from the same type
* Ordered: the first and subsequent elements can be determined

It has two parts:

* Index: number of components and how to acess them. They refer to components.
* Component: the elements

To refer to one component, you need:

* name of array
* index of the element

### Definition

indentifier = ARRAY[min_limit..max_limit] OF type

NTC: max_limit - min_limit + 1

### Operations

1. Reading/Writing
2. Assigning
3. Updating: inserting, deleting and modifying
4. Ordering
5. Searching

## Bidimensional Arrays

It is a finite, homogenous and ordered group where every element is refered by two indexes.
The first one is for row and the second one for column.
